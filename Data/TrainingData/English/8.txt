Sunday is unique day
For many people Sunday is that day when they can visit their families or devote themselves to praying. Yet there is something more to say about Sunday.

First and foremost, traffic is not so heavy as on week days. For instance, I leave my house and go across the street where I observe almost no cars. There is quiet everywhere, because people stay at home rather than struggle with everyday problems. On Sunday people want to go for a walk to a park or to the beach on foot than by car.

Secondly, people are in the habit of being lazy on Sunday. They know that after the whole week of work the last day of the weekend is devoted to relaxing. For example, my friend works from nine to five. He likes going fishing on Sunday in order to wind down. He knows that on week days he must work. On the other hand some people enjoy reading a book the whole day. They drink tea and sit on their balcony or go off into the blue where they can be completely alone. This is the way that helps them to recharge their batteries.

To sum up, Sunday is one of a kind day when we can rest from traffic and switch ourselves off.
