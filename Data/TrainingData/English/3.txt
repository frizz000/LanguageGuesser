I'm great fan of comedy movies so my favourite film is "Kiler" directed by Juliusz Machulski. The main role plays Cezary Pazura. The film tells the story of Warsaw cabbie - Jurek Kiler. He lands behind bars, having been taken by inspector Fish for the most dangerous contract killer. Jurek sprung from jail with Siara's help - a Warsaw mafia boss. Jurek gets a contract to kill a TV presenter - Ewa. He manages to do all the contracts he was commissioned with Ewa's help. Luckily the story has its happy end. It's great film for all comedy fans. I recomended it to anyone who likes laughing. It's worth seeing.
