Your hobby

Everyone has a hobby. Some of them are relly weird while some are down-to-earth. I collect postcards. I travel a lot and in every city I'm I buy one postcard. If the pictures of a city are relly nice, I buy two of every postcard for exchange. When I came home I change doubled cards for other with my friends. My collection is getting bigger and bigger. All my family know about my hobby so if they go somewhere they buy a postcard for me. When I started collecting postcards I had already a number of them. I got about 300 postcards from my grandma. She used to travel a lot. In fact she encouraged me to collect the pictures of cities.
