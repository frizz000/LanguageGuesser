Your favourite pet
I love animals. Some people keep reptiles in their homes. I think it's stupid. People should keep only those animals which are made to live in captivity. Dogs are very friendly and don't suffer when they live with people. I have a dog myself. She is called Tina. She is huge, black, pedigree sheepdog. She has her own kennel. Generally, she lives in in the garden, but during the winter, when temperature is below -10 degrees Celsius, she is allowed to spend the night in the house. She is a good dog. When Tina sees a stranger she always barks so all the family know that there is something wrong going on. When I come back from school she always welcomes me wagging her tail. She is the best dog I could ever had. I wouldn't change her for any dog in the world.
