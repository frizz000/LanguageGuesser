Favourite kind of music

I like listening to music. I don't know what I would do if there was no music. Whatever I do the radio is beside me. The only place where I can't listen to my favourite pieces of music is school. I don't have any specifications of what I listen to. The only kind of music I really can't stand is Polish "disco polo". Apart from this, I tolerate all other sorts of music. I like sit down in my armchair and turn on my stereo. I usually listen to the radio but if there is nothing interesting on I put a CD in a slot and play music loudly. Sometimes my neighbours are really angry with me about disturbing them.
