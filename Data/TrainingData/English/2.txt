I'm going to go to the seaside with my friends in the summer. We will get to ≈Åeba by train as it's the cheapest means of transport. We will live in tents. I have already booked the place where we can pitch them. During the day I'll be lying on the beach with my friends. I'll be sunbathing so when I come back I'll have a great tan. I also like swimming in the sea. I will probably try some water sports like surfing. I have never done it before so it will be a great experience. I'm a good swimmer so it's impossible for me to drown. After dark, I will be going to the discos with my friends. We will be dancing all night. I hope the weather will be nice.
