Bytom is my home town, it is one of the oldest towns in Upper Silesia. Bytom's 900 years history has begun in the early Middle Ages. In the place, where today Saint Margarita's Hill is, in IX century there was a castle. In course of time around the castle a market colony came into being, it was a beginning of our future town. The quick development of town depended not only on trade, but also large ledge of silver, lead and coal. Nowadays, the heraldic arms of our town testify to its mining traditions. However the extraction of coal for ages and tectonic movements make that the area of our town has been lowering systematically, particularly in the centre of Bytom, in Miechowice district and in DÄ…browa Miejska.

Bytom is a town of a great cultural offer, it is famous in the country and abroad for many artistic achievements, particularly in dancing, music and singing. In Bytom there is the State Silesian Opera, which is well known also abroad. A great deal of Polish and world premieres took place on our stage. The proud of Bytom is Silesian Theatre of Dance. Besides, the Centre of Culture patronises Bytom's Chamber Orchestra "Camerata Impuls". In the artistic attainments of that group there are two compact discs with some baroque music and with the XIX century one. The Upper Silesian Museum is one of the richest and the most interesting among such places in Poland. The Public City Library proposes to its readers a great collection of literature: belles-lettres, popularised scientific, specialistic and some audio-video offers.
