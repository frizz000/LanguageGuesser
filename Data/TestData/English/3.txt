Dear Father Christmas!
I am so glad I can finally write to you! I found out from my best friend that you can realize my wishes. I should not ask you about money, material things or clothes, but... I will be happy if you help me in better understanding this world. Give me the power of forgiving to do not harm anybody. Help me also to find new friends. And do not forget about my family. Do not permit someone to he has to cry by me. Let me to will be yet better and cleverer. I would like to get on my long dreamt of studies also, so it will be magnificently if I give such possibility. I must write something now because I will forget. I know that you can not realize all my plans. Have a look in my blue eyes and give me what I really need. And in the end give me a bit of warmth to believe that all these dreams come true! I believe that in year inflected Greg will write to you!

Take care! Always loving Greg
