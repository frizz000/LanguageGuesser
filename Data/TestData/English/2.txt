In our town there are also Youth Culture Houses, art galleries, music clubs, cinemas and social-cultural societies e.g. Lovers of Bytom Society.

Every year all dwellers of Bytom and those who live in neighbourhood are invited for June holiday called Days of Bytom. During that time everybody can take part in some cultural events, sport competitions or concerts of some famous singers.

Nowadays, Bytom has a population of 204 thousands inhabitants. The main localisation advantages are: good developed network of roads and railways connections, variable means of transport: buses, trams and taxis. All of this make the economic and cultural contacts with our town very intensive.

But for many inhabitants the most important thing is that since several years Bytom has been changing its image. There isn't such terrified pollution like it was a decade ago. We have great amount of new, splendid shops and hypermarkets. There is much more flowers and bushes in the centre of our town. Majority of the monumental buildings were renovated - now they are really beautiful. Moreover, we have a redecorated market place with a very modern, eye-catching fountain, and a brand new attractive shopping centre with a cinema offering a wide range of films for everybody - all in the heart of the city.
