# LanguageGuesser
This project is a Java-based language classifier that utilizes single-layer perceptrons to predict the language of a given text input. It is designed as a JavaFX application with a user-friendly interface that allows users to input text, train the classifier with a specified learning rate, and retrain it if needed.
